# Minimal Unittest framework for C and C++
Yet another minimal unittest framework for C and C++, but this one does not depend on anything. The reason for this is to allow unittests to be run on an embedded target. Adapted from modified from [Minunit](https://github.com/siu/minunit).
## Usage
This library is intended to be used as a git submodule in other projects. For usage example please see [MinUnitTests](https://github.com/squantor/MinUnitTests) for more details.
